This file try to prepare a task list that should take priority over
others. Attributes of the task: priority and difficulty are presented,
whoese value range from 1 to 5. This list should be consulted when a
translator is deciding what file to work on. You can either decide by the
priority or the difficulty. There are quite a lot of files that are very
important but very hard to translate too!

Note: This is for reference only. What file is important and what isn't is
totaly arbitary. So feel free to pick the one you like.
